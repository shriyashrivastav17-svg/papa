This is a simple interactive webpage created as a virtual birthday card.

Features

Start: Click the "Start!" button to light the candles.

Mic Input: The page will ask for microphone permission.

Blow Candles: Blow into your microphone to make the sound-level bar increase. A loud enough sound will "blow out" the candles.

Cut Cake: After the candles are out, a "Cut the Cake!" button appears.

Message: Clicking the button will "cut" the cake and reveal a special birthday message.

How to Run

Make sure all three files (index.html, style.css, and script.js) are in the same folder.

Open the index.html file in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).

The browser will ask for microphone permission. You must click "Allow" for the candle-blowing feature to work.

This project uses Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
